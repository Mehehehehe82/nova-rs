//! Nova's Render Hardware Interface
//!
//! This is an interface to the GPU which has been designed for Nova. It abstracts away parts of the
//! underlying APIs which Nova doesn't use, providing an interface that's more productive and more
//! fun. The RHI is actually split into two sections: the synchronous parts and the asynchronous
//! part. The synchronous part of the API is where your calls happen immediately on the GPU, while
//! the asynchronous part is where your calls get recorded into command lists, which are later
//! executed on the GPU
